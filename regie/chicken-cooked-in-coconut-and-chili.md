### Chicken cooked in coconut and chilli

#### Ingredients

- 3 lbs chicken thighs/breasts (preferably with bone in)
- 1 onion, diced
- 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 thumb of ginger, sliced into discs
- 1 chayote, chopped in ~1” cubes
- 1/2 lb chili leaves (or spinach)
- 1-2 small red chilis, chopped (can do more if you like spicier)
- 2 cans coconut milk 
- ~2 tbsp fish sauce 

#### Special equipment:
- big pot or wok

#### Directions

1. Heat pot with oil on medium. Add onion and garlic and sautée until fragrant. Stir in ginger, chili, and fish sauce, then add chicken. Add a couple of dashes of salt and pepper. Cook for ~5 minutes, until chicken is brown on the outside.
2. Pour in coconut milk and bring to a simmer. Cover, cooking for another 5 minutes. Add in chayote and cook covered for another 10 minutes.
3. Serve hot over steamed rice.

#### Notes

- Can substitute chicken with anything from tofu to fish to pork. If cooking with tofu, I recommend adding a little bit of vegetable or chicken stock for flavour.
- I don't recommend substituting chicken with canned young jackfruit - use fresh or you're gonna need to blanch it for 20 mins to get rid of the briny taste.
- Chili leaves can be tricky to find, so spinach or bok choy are okay substitutes.
- I often see chayote in superstore so I don't think it's rare, but in the off chance they don't carry them, then something like potatoes will work.
- This is one of those recipes where you can really toss in anything. The main theme is "_____ cooked in coconut milk and chili", so you can toss in any combination of protein and veggies you want.
