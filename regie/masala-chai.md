### Cardamom-y and Cinnamon-y Grandma Recipe (Serves 4-5)

#### Ingredients

- Orange pekoe tea 
    - Taj Mahal tea is pretty good, but cleanup can be messy since it's loose leaf
    - You know those big wooden stir spoons? Like three heaping spoonfuls of them. Otherwise, use like a tea bag per person or something
- Milk, like at least a litre
- Sugar
- 6-8 cardamom pods, smashed but doesn't need to be ground fine
- a thumb of cinnamon, smashed but doens't need to be ground fine

To be extra:
- 3-4 sliced discs of ginger
- ground star anise (haven't used whole ones yet, but I just sprinkle vigorously for 5 seconds or more)
- 1 clove, smashed
- you can add anything really. Turmeric, black pepper, etc. It's just spiced tea.

#### Special equipment:
- Medium pot
- Mortar and pestle to crush/grind spices

#### Directions

1. Heat like a knuckle's depth of water in a pot. Toss in tea and spices and let the concentrate simmer until the tea has steeped to a very dark brown.
2. Pour in milk until colour reaches about a #c98b54 and let heat until milk starts to bubble and foam up. Remove from heat before it overflows.
3. Strain into mugs and add desired amount of sugar.


#### Notes

- Can make the concentrate ahead of time and keep refrigerated until you feel like adding it to milk
- For a quick fix, you can get those david's tea bags and put your orange pekoe in with two smashed cardamom pods and some cinnamon. Then plunk it into steamed/microwaved milk. Won't be as strong, but it gets the job done.
