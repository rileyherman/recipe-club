# Garlic Mashed Potatoes
### Garlicky, garlicky potatoes (Serves 4-5)

#### Ingredients

- 4 large red potatoes 
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1-2 bulbs or garlic
- salt and pepper to taste

#### Special equipment:
- Pot to boil potatoes in
- Something to mash potatoes with

#### Directions

1. An hour ahead of time, chop the tops off of the garlic for easy removal after roasting. Drizzle bulbs in olive oil and wrap in aluminum foil. Roast in oven or toaster oven at 350 Farenheit for an hour.
2. Cut potatoes into quarters and toss in boiling water for 20 minutes or until you can easily slide a fork through a piece. Strain and return to the pot. Squeeze out roasted garlic from the skin if you haven't already and mash the garlic to a paste.
3. Mash the potatoes to the consistency you want, mixing in butter and milk. Incorporate garlic paste and mix well. Add salt and pepper to taste.
4. Serve with an entree of your choice.


#### Notes

- This requires you to roast a garlic bulb or two for an hour ahead of time. Try to time it so that when the potatoes are ready for straining, the garlic is still warm but not so hot as to burn your fingers during removal from the garlic skin. They'll squeeze right out.
- If you really like garlic, go with 2 bulbs. I personally don't taste enough with 1, but I like garlic a lot.
