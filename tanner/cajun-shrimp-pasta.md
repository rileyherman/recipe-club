# Cajun Shrimp Pasta

#### Ingredients
- 1 lb. Shrimp (tail off, thawed if frozen)
- 12 ounces bow tie pasta
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp minced garlic (let's be real, we're all going to use at least 2 tbsp)
- 2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning (I probably use closer to 3)
- 1/3 cup white wine 
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
- 1 1/2 cups Parmesan cheese finely grated
- 1 15 oz. can diced tomatoes drained
 
 #### Directions

 1. Start boiling water. When ready cook pasta and drain.
 2. In a large pan heat oil over medium heat. Stir in 1 tbsp of cajun seasoning. Cook the shrimp in the cajun oil. Remove when done and set aside.
 3. Deglaze the pan with the white wine. Simmer for 1 or 2 minutes and then add the butter and garlic. Whisk to combine until the butter is completely melted and the garlic is fragrant. 
 4. Stir in heavy cream with the rest of the cajun seasoning (to taste). Bring to a simmer for 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and add the parmesan cheese, diced tomatoes, pasta and shrimp. Once everything is combined and warm it's ready to serve.
