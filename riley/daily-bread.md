# Bread

#### Ingredients

 - 550 g water
 - 2 tsp salt
 - 2 tsp yeast
 - 600 g flour
 
 #### Special Equipment
 
 - ice cream pail with holes poked in lid
 - kitchen scale
 - wooden/plastic spoon or spatula
 - baking stone, pizza stone, clean floor tile, something like that
 - pie plate or similar alternative (needs to be oven safe)
 - parchment paper

 #### Directions

 1. Put a clean ice cream pail on a kitchen scale and tare
 2. Add water and salt. Stir until dissolved with wooden spoon (or plastic spatula)
 3. Add dry yeast
 4. Tare scale and add flour one scoop at a time
 5. Mix until just combined. Be careful not to over mix
 6. Let rise for about two hours
 7. Refridgerate for 8ish hours before first time baking
 8. Get out parchment paper, flour, bread knife and dough
 9. Flour hands lightly. Grab about a grapefruit sized hunk of dough and use the knife to cut it away from the rest. Add a little flour (enought for the dough not to stick to your hands), shape and place on parchment paper. This step should take no more than 30ish seconds, otherwise the dough may get overworked.
 10. Let rise for 30ish minutes and preheat the oven to 450F. The oven racks should be in the middle and directly below the middle. Let the baking stone preheat with the oven.
 11. Pick up the parchment paper with the dough and place on baking stone. With the other oven rack, put about a cup of water in a pie plate and place on rack just below the stone.
 12. Bake for 20ish minutes, then remove the parchment paper and place loaf directly on baking stone
 13. Bake for another 10ish minutes
 14. Let the loaf cool for about 30 minutes before cutting - the inside won't quite be done yet!
 15. Enjoy! Do steps 8-14 until there's no dough left. The dough keeps about 2 weeks in the fridge. The longer it waits, the more sourdoughy it gets. Also if you do this regularly then don't clean the ice cream pail each time - the leftover bits stuck to the edges act as a starter for the next batch.
