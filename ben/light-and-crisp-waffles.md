# Light and Crisp Waffles

Makes around 8 waffles, depending on size of your waffle maker

#### Ingredients

 - 2 eggs
 - 2 cups (500mL) milk
 - 2 cups (500mL) all-purpose flour
 - 1 tablespoon (15mL) baking powder
 - 1/2 tsp (2mL) salt
 - 1/3 cup (75mL) oil (I use canola oil)

 #### Directions

 1. Preheat waffle maker
 2. Separate the egg yolks and whites. Put the egg yolks in a large mixer bowl and put the egg whites in a separate bowl.
 3. Stiffly beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on high until they are a fluffy mousse texture.
 4. Add the milk, flour, baking powder, salt, and oil to the mixer bowl with the egg yolks.
 5. Beat this bowl on low until moistened, then increase the speed to medium until smooth.
 6. By hand, gently fold in the beaten egg whites.
 7. Spray PAM or other spray oil onto waffle grid and pour batter over the grids. Amount will vary per waffle maker, but I pour 1/2 cup.
 8. Bake 2.5-3 minutes or until golden.
 9. Repeat until out of batter
