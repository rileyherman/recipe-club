# Sausage Carbonara

### Ingredients

- 5 oz dried noodles (the flat kind, linguini?)
- 3 sausages 
- a bunch of parsley
- 1 large egg
- 1 oz parmesan

Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the box. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water. 


While pasta cooks, squeeze the sausage meat out of the skins and shape into 15-20 even-sized balls. Sprinkle on some pepper. 
Add some oil to a frying pan, and add the meatballs when the pan is hot. 


Chop up the parsley (including the stalks), whisk with 1 egg and a splash of pasta water. Grate & mix in most of the parm. 


Combine pasta, egg mixture, and meatballs. The egg is supposed to cook in the residual heat. Splash in more pasta water. Season with salt, pepper, and parmesan.
