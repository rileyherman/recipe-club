### Chicken to impress Jesse's Parents

Please note that Dwayne is Celiac so if you make any changes to this recipe, they can't have gluten. If you add any gluten, you will fail at impressing Jesse's parents. Link to the original recipe: https://www.melskitchencafe.com/grilled-caprese-chicken/

#### Ingredients

- fresh basil (chopped)
- 2 tbsp red wine vinegar
- 4 garlic cloves (original recipe uses 2 but 4 is more impressive)
- pepper & salt
- olive oil (or canola oil, original recipe used olive oil but Jesse's parents won't be able to tell the difference)
- mozarella!
- chicken breasts
- tomatoes


#### Directions

1. Combine the basil, vinegar, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Whisk in the oil. Transfer 3 tablespoons of the mixture to a bowl with the mozarella and mix it up.

2. Pat the chicken pieces dry with a paper towel and season both sides with salt and pepper.

3. Slice tomatoes and put a slice or two on top of each piece of chicken. Ideally you grill the chicken on an actual barbecue but I'm scared of barbecues so I usually put it in the oven. If you are using the oven preheat to 350F. Bake until the chicken is cooked (25 mins-ish).

4. Sometime after you start cooking the chicken, take it out of the oven/bbq and add the mozarella pieces on top. The idea is for the mozarella to get all melty, it needs like 3-5 mins or so. 

5. Pour the rest of the basil mixture on the chicken. 

6. Make an impressive side dish of your choice. Make sure it's gluten free.

7. Great success
